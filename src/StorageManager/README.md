WIP  
currently can record opened container data and view them.  
this is designed for vanilla server. for modded server just install [AE2](https://modrinth.com/mod/ae2) or [SS](https://modrinth.com/mod/toms-storage) or something like that.  
this service doesn't depend on any library outside of this folder.  

as i write more i started thinking it might be easier to just make it into [standalone mod](https://github.com/aMelonRind/StorageBrowser)...  
MethodWrapper is assignable to java.util.function.* anyways, still customizable through jsmacros

after some more thinking i guess i'll make a jsm extension to handle heavy processes instead of standalong
