# Types
Contains:
* Tweaked JsMacros-1.8.3 mc-1.19.2 type environment
* My own types for my script

## Install JsMacros Types
Unzip the zip, put the `node_modules` folder to the same folder as `Macros` then restart vscode (idk other IDE need restart or not)

## My Types
You can put the `MeloTypes.d.ts` into `node_modules/@types/jsm/` if you want. Remember to modify the index.d.ts file so it'll actually include the ts
